# This is based off of XeroLinux's Layan Rice

This is based off of Xero theme, with adjustments for my personal preferences.

### Disclaimer

I would like to clarify one very important aspect of ricing. We use custom themes, and those might not get updated very often, if at all by their respective developers/artists, which might result in some parts of the system and apps not to get themed correctly. That, my friends, is unfortunately out of our hands.


### Performance :

This rice has been throughly optimized for best performance on higher-end systems.. Although it might work on lower-end ones, for better performance I do not recommend that you use it there. So please do not report any performance issues.

### Installation

**Install At Own Risk!!!**. As of now it supports **Plasma 6.x.x**. If you notice any issues and report them via issue tracker on here and I will do my best to address them. To apply the rice, please follow the commands posted below. You will need either **Paru** or **Yay** (installed via my toolkit). Keep in mind that this will replace some files. Read below...

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mkromis/DragonBorn-Theme.git
cd DragonBorn-Theme/ && ./install.sh
```

* Grub theming is not being used. Keeping old file for possible future use.
